# Blazor PWA on GitHub Pages

This repository serves as proof of concept and demonstration of how a [Blazor WebAssembly PWA](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/blazor/progressive-web-app) can be hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). The result can be seen [here](https://proulxsamuel.github.io/blazor-pwa-on-gh-pages/).

The deployment process is fully automated through the [`deploy-blazor-to-gh-pages`](https://github.com/proulxsamuel/deploy-blazor-to-gh-pages) [GitHub Action](https://github.com/features/actions) which is set up in the file [`workflows/deploy.yml`](.github/workflows/deploy.yml).
